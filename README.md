# Prism
Have you ever wanted to be able to look at **any** color and _instantly_ identify what hexcode it is? 

Catch a glimpse of a home intruder before they slip out the window and identify the exact color of their eyes hours later for the police report? Memorize your mom's favorite "golden brown" cookie color so you know when they're perfectly baked? Remember Bob Ross's paint palette so you don't pick out the wrong Titanium White at the art store?

Look no further - Prism is an app that generates visually appealing tesselations of colors perfectly suited to training your mind to guess the right hexcodes.

## Instructions
Just guess the color in the middle triangle by adjusting the adjacent triangles (which are more red, green, and blue) and tapping the center when you're done. A green bar will pop up telling you close you are (and sometimes, you'll get a special surprise if you're good enough)!
